README for libdmtx-vala version 0.7.2 - September 4, 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx-vala is a Vala binding for libdmtx that was written by
Evan Nemerson and is distributed as part of the libdmtx package.


1. libdmtx-vala Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Simply copy libdmtx.vapi into the directory where valac looks for
vapis. This is usually /usr/share/vala/vapi, but if you are
unsure and vala is installed, you can use pkg-config to obtain
the location by running:

  $ pkg-config --variable=vapidir vala-1.0

If you do not wish to install the bindings globally, you can use
valac's --vapidir argument instead.


2. Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To use these bindings, you will need valac-0.7.6 or greater, and
libdmtx-0.7.2 or greater.


3. Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------

An example program, test.vala, is included with these bindings.
This program will user Cairo to generate a PDF containing a data
matrix barcode. To compile it, simply run:

  $ valac -o test --pkg libdmtx --pkg cairo test.vala

Compiling any other libdmtx vala code is just as simple. Simply
add --pkg libdmtx, and valac will handle the rest.
