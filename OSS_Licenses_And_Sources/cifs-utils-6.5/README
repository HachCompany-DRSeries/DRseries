This is the release version of cifs-utils, a package of utilities for
doing and managing mounts of the Linux CIFS filesystem. These programs
were originally part of Samba, but have now been split off into a
separate package.

1. COMPILING

If you pulled down the git tree directly, then you'll need to
generate the autoconf/automake files before you can build. cd to
the top of the build tree and run:

    $ autoreconf -i

If you downloaded a release tarball, then just unpack the sources
and run these commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

To install binaries and documentation, run this (as root):

    # make install
