.SH "NAME"
cifs.idmap \- Userspace helper for mapping ids for Common Internet File System (CIFS)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
cifs.idmap [--help|-h] [--timeout|-t] [--version|-v] {keyid}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite\&.
.PP
cifs\&.idmap is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client filesystem\&. There are a number of activities that the kernel cannot easily do itself\&. This program is a callout program that does these things for the kernel and then returns the result\&.
.PP
cifs\&.idmap is generally intended to be run when the kernel calls request\-key(8)
for a particular key type\&. While it can be run directly from the command\-line, it is not generally intended to be run that way\&.
.PP
This program is only called if a share is mounted with the \fBcifsacl\fR mount
option. The kernel will only upcall to do this conversion if that mount option
is specified.
.PP
cifs.idmap relies on a plugin to handle the ID mapping. If it can't find the
plugin then it will not work properly. The plugin (or a symlink to it) must be
at \fB@pluginpath@\fR.
.PP
In the case where cifs.idmap or the plugin are unavailable, file objects in a mounted share are assigned uid and gid of the credentials of the process that mounted the share\&. It is strongly recomemended to use mount options of uid and gid to specify a default uid and gid to map owner SIDs and group SIDs in this
situation.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
--help|-h
.RS
Print the usage message and exit.
.RE
.PP
--timeout|-t
.RS 4
Set the expiration timer, in seconds on the key. The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes). Setting this to 0 will cause the key to never expire.
.RE
.PP
\-\-version|\-v
.RS 4
Print version number and exit\&.

.SH "CONFIGURATION FOR KEYCTL"
.PP
cifs\&.idmap is designed to be called from the kernel via the request\-key callout program\&. This requires that request\-key be told where and how to call this program\&. Currently cifs\&.idmap handles a key type of:
.PP
cifs\&.idmap
.RS 4
This keytype is for mapping a SID to either an uid or a gid
.RE
.PP
To make this program useful for CIFS, you will need to set up entry for it in request\-key\&.conf(5)\&. Here is an example of an entry for this key type:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#OPERATION  TYPE           D C PROGRAM ARG1 ARG2\&.\&.\&.
#=========  =============  = = ================================
create      cifs\&.idmap     * * @sbindir@/cifs\&.idmap %k
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
See
\fBrequest-key.conf\fR(5)
for more info on each field\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Support for upcalls to cifs.idmap was initially introduced in the 3.0 kernel.
