A console project opening another window for viewing images, made with MS Visual C++ 6.0

This console project demonstrates how to open a window for viewing images. The
code included here, opens all images available in ipl98\examples\images and
shows them in the new window.

The project depends on the library project ipl98library present in the folder
ipl98/projects/visaulc/ipl98library.

This means, if you compile this project (ConsoleIPL) and the library files are 
not available, it will automatically compile the ipl98library project.

The project was created by
