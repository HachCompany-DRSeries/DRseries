A simple console project made with MS Visual C++ 6.0

The project depends on the library project ipl98library present in the folder
ipl98/projects/visaulc/ipl98library.

This means, if you compile this project (ConsoleIPL) and the library files are 
not available, it will automatically compile the ipl98library project.
